This repository contains a Civ IV-style strategy game implemented in Unity.

## Project Layout (scaffolded)
- Assets/
  - Art/, Audio/, Prefabs/, Scenes/
  - Scripts/
    - Simulation/ (pure C# domain model)
    - Presentation/ (Unity components and visuals)
    - Infrastructure/ (data, save/load)
  - StreamingAssets/ (data, saves)
  - UI/ (UI Toolkit layouts and styles)

## Next Step
Create a new Unity project in this folder using Unity Hub (latest LTS),
then open the project so Unity can generate the standard ProjectSettings/ and
